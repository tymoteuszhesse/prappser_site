Users will send through the internet app state changes, app join requests etc. in a form of JSON events.  We do not want to be able to track our users in any way.

It is message broker optimized for IoT. It allows to create infinite amount of topics.\nThere are a few of hosted brokers available for free. \n\n- Good, because MQTT protocol is fitted for our case\n- Bad, because MQTT public servers are limited\n- Bad, because we cannot be so sure if they will be enabled all the time\n- Bad, because they scale poorly (the instance hosted in one region and nothing more)\n- Bad, because we cannot send big files\n\n### Shared Cloud folders\n\nEach user nowadays have some kind of Cloud Storage account (Google Drive/Dropbox/Mega/OneDrive...). And rather all of these solutions allows to share the folders by publicly available link.\nOne user can then connect with other user by creating a shared folder. If two users will create a shared folder for themselves then there is possible a file based communication. Each shared folder can contain subfolders which can be used like topics in message brokers.\n\n- Good, because scalable.
